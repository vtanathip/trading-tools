# Constitution Update Summary

## Version Information

- **New Version**: 1.0.0
- **Ratification Date**: 2025-10-20
- **Last Amended**: 2025-10-20
- **Version Type**: MAJOR (Initial constitution creation)

## Principles Defined

### ✅ I. Code Quality (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Focus**: Readability, maintainability, and single responsibility

Key requirements:
- Clear, self-documenting code
- Single responsibility per function/class/module
- DRY principle enforcement
- No magic numbers
- Type safety required
- Mandatory code reviews

### ✅ II. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Focus**: Comprehensive testing across all projects

Key requirements:
- Test-first development (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Minimum 80% code coverage (100% for critical trading logic)
- Multiple test types: unit, integration, contract, edge case
- Automated testing in CI/CD
- Given-When-Then test documentation
- No skipped tests without justification

### ✅ III. User Experience Consistency

**Focus**: Intuitive and consistent interfaces

Key requirements:
- Consistent patterns across all tools
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Both human-readable and JSON output formats
- Immediate feedback for all operations
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 Level AA for web)
- Documentation-first UX

### ✅ IV. Simplicity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Focus**: Start simple, add complexity only when necessary

Key requirements:
- YAGNI principle enforcement
- Minimal, justified dependencies
- Clear, obvious architecture
- Incremental delivery
- No premature optimization
- Delete before adding
- Written justification for complexity

## Additional Sections Added

### Documentation Standards

- Every subproject MUST have a current README.md
- Documentation MUST be updated when features/APIs/structure changes
- No stale documentation allowed

### Development Workflow

- Constitution check gates at three stages: before implementation, during implementation, before merge
- Quality gates: linting, type checking, security scanning, performance baselines

### Governance

- Amendment process defined
- Version semantics (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Enforcement procedures
- Quarterly compliance reviews

## Template Updates

### ✅ plan-template.md

**Status**: Updated

**Changes**:
- Constitution Check section now includes specific checklist items
- Three gate stages defined: Before Implementation, During Implementation, Before Merge
- Each checkpoint references specific principles

### ✅ spec-template.md

**Status**: Aligned (no changes required)

**Verification**:
- User scenario format supports UX consistency principle (Principle III)
- Given-When-Then format aligns with testing standards (Principle II)
- Independent test requirement supports incremental delivery (Principle IV)

### ✅ tasks-template.md

**Status**: Aligned (no changes required)

**Verification**:
- Test-first approach reflected in task ordering (tests before implementation)
- User story organization supports incremental delivery (Principle IV)
- Task format supports clear documentation (Principle I)

## Files Modified

1. `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Created with complete constitution
2. `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` - Updated Constitution Check section

## Suggested Commit Message

```
docs: create constitution v1.0.0 with 4 core principles

- Add Code Quality principle (readability, single responsibility, DRY)
- Add Testing Standards principle (test-first, 80% coverage minimum)
- Add User Experience Consistency principle (consistent patterns, clear errors)
- Add Simplicity principle (YAGNI, minimal dependencies, incremental delivery)
- Define documentation standards for subprojects
- Establish development workflow with constitution check gates
- Update plan-template.md with specific constitution checkpoints
```

## Next Steps for Subproject Documentation

As requested, each subproject should have a README.md that explains:

1. **What it does** - One-sentence summary
2. **How to use it** - Installation and basic usage examples
3. **Project structure** - Overview of folders and key files
4. **How to run tests** - Testing commands and requirements
5. **How to contribute** - Development workflow

**Important**: Update these READMEs only when something changes. No need to create documentation upfront - create it when you create the subproject or make significant changes.

## Follow-up TODOs

None - constitution is complete and ready for use.
