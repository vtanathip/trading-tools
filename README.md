> Tools to help you trade better

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of trading tools designed to help traders make better decisions through reliable software, consistent user experiences, and maintainable code.

## Project Principles

All tools in this repository follow our [Constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md), which defines four core principles:

1. **Code Quality** - Clean, readable, maintainable code with mandatory reviews
2. **Testing Standards** - Test-first development with 80% minimum coverage
3. **User Experience Consistency** - Consistent patterns and clear interfaces across all tools
4. **Simplicity** - Start simple, add complexity only when necessary (YAGNI)
