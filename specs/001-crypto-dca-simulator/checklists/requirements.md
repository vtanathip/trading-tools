# Specification Quality Checklist: Crypto DCA Simulator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS

- Specification focuses on WHAT users need (DCA simulation capabilities) without specifying HOW (no mention of React, Vue, specific charting libraries)
- Written from user perspective (traders wanting to analyze DCA strategies)
- All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS

- All 24 functional requirements are specific and testable
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (30 seconds, 3 seconds, 90%, 375px)
- Success criteria avoid implementation (e.g., "functions without internet" not "uses service workers")
- Each user story has 4 acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases identified (7 scenarios covering data availability, offline, errors)
- Constraints and Out of Scope sections clearly bound what is/isn't included
- Assumptions section documents all reasonable defaults taken

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS

- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- Three user stories (P1: basic simulation, P2: comparison, P3: parameter adjustment) cover core workflows
- Success criteria directly support user value (quick setup, fast results, mobile support)
- No technical implementation leaked (no mention of frameworks, libraries, build tools)

## Notes

All validation items pass. Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization (P1-P3) enables MVP-first development
- Comprehensive edge cases identified early
- Reasonable assumptions documented (no authentication, browser cache only, simplified model)
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused

**Recommendation**: Proceed to planning phase.
