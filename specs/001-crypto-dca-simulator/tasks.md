# Tasks: Crypto DCA Simulator

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-crypto-dca-simulator/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Constitution Principle II requires test-first development. DCA calculator requires 100% coverage. All other code requires 80% minimum coverage.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md, this is a single-page web application with structure:

- `crypto-dca-simulator/src/` - Source code
- `crypto-dca-simulator/tests/` - Test files
- `crypto-dca-simulator/public/` - Static assets

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (Phase 3): Independent after Phase 2
  - User Story 2 (Phase 4): Builds on User Story 1 but independently testable
  - User Story 3 (Phase 5): Builds on User Story 1 but independently testable
- **Sharing (Phase 6)**: Depends on at least User Story 1 completion
- **Enhanced UX (Phase 7)**: Can start after Phase 2, parallel with user stories
- **Performance (Phase 8)**: Depends on user stories being implemented
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired features being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - MVP baseline
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 chart/results components
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 form component

### Critical Path

1. **T001-T013**: Setup (parallelizable)
2. **T014-T024**: Foundational services (blocks everything)
3. **T025-T026**: DCA Calculator (CRITICAL - 100% coverage, blocks all user stories)
4. **T027-T037**: User Story 1 implementation (MVP)
5. Everything else can be incremental after MVP

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T003-T013 all parallel (different config files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Parallel tasks available

- T014-T017 parallel (different utility files)

- T027-T029 parallel (SimulatorForm + tests + styles)
- T030-T032 parallel (ChartDisplay + tests + styles)
- T033-T034 parallel (ResultsSummary + tests)

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**: Parallel tasks available

- T038-T039 parallel (AssetComparison component development)

**Phase 7 (Enhanced UX)**: Parallel tasks available

- T061-T062 parallel (independent components)
- T069-T070 parallel (different validation functions)

**Phase 8 (Performance)**: Parallel tasks available

- T071-T072 parallel (different CSS files)

**Phase 9 (Polish)**: Parallel tasks available

# Phase 2: Launch foundational tests together
Task T021: "tests/unit/validators.test.ts"
Task T022: "tests/unit/formatters.test.ts"
<parameter name="Task T023: "tests/unit/dateHelpers.test.ts"

# Phase 3: After T025-T026 (DCA Calculator), launch UI components together
Task T027-T029: "SimulatorForm + tests + styles"
Task T030-T032: "ChartDisplay + tests + styles"
Task T033-T034: "ResultsSummary + tests"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. **Setup**: Complete Phase 1 (T001-T013)
2. **Foundation**: Complete Phase 2 (T014-T024) - CRITICAL blocking phase
3. **DCA Calculator**: Complete T025-T026 with 100% coverage
4. **User Story 1**: Complete Phase 3 (T027-T037)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
6. Deploy MVP to Azure Blob Storage
7. Gather feedback before proceeding

**Estimated Tasks for MVP**: 37 tasks (T001-T037)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation Ready**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 complete (T001-T024)
2. **MVP Release**: + User Story 1 (T025-T037) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo ‚úÖ
3. **Comparison Feature**: + User Story 2 (T038-T045) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo ‚úÖ
4. **Parameter Editing**: + User Story 3 (T046-T054) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo ‚úÖ
5. **Sharing**: + Phase 6 (T055-T060) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo ‚úÖ
6. **Polish**: + Phases 7-9 (T061-T090) ‚Üí Final Release ‚úÖ

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Phase 2 completion:

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T025-T037) - MVP critical path
- **Developer B**: Enhanced UX (T061-T070) - parallel with MVP
- **Developer C**: Setup Phase 8 prep (research, mobile testing) - parallel with MVP

Then after US1 complete:

- **Developer A**: User Story 2 (T038-T045)
- **Developer B**: User Story 3 (T046-T054)
- **Developer C**: Sharing functionality (T055-T060)

## Test-First Workflow (Constitution Requirement)

Per Constitution Principle II, ALL tasks must follow Red-Green-Refactor:

### Red Phase

1. Write test (e.g., T025 dcaCalculator.test.js)
2. Run test ‚Üí Verify it FAILS
3. Commit failing test

### Green Phase

1. Write minimal implementation (e.g., T026 dcaCalculator.js)
2. Run test ‚Üí Verify it PASSES
3. Commit passing implementation

### Refactor Phase

1. Improve code quality (readability, DRY, single responsibility)
2. Run test ‚Üí Verify still PASSES
3. Commit refactored code

**Checkpoint Gates**:

- Before implementation: Tests exist and fail ‚úÖ
- Before commit: Tests pass, coverage meets thresholds ‚úÖ
- Before merge: All tests pass, documentation updated ‚úÖ

---

## Coverage Requirements

Per Constitution Principle II:

- **General Code**: 80% minimum coverage
- **DCA Calculator** (T025-T026): 100% coverage (CRITICAL calculation logic)
- **Services** (priceApi, cacheManager, urlSerializer): 90%+ recommended
- **Components**: 80% minimum
- **Utils**: 85%+ recommended (reusable functions)

---

## Task Completion Criteria

Each task is complete when:

1. ‚úÖ Code written following Constitution Principle I (readability, single responsibility, DRY)
2. ‚úÖ Tests written first and pass (Principle II)
3. ‚úÖ ESLint passes with no warnings
4. ‚úÖ Prettier formatting applied
5. ‚úÖ Coverage thresholds met
6. ‚úÖ Acceptance criteria verified (for user story tasks)
7. ‚úÖ Code reviewed (if team > 1 person)
8. ‚úÖ Committed to feature branch with clear message

---

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Tasks**: 90 tasks
- **User Story 1 (MVP)**: 13 implementation tasks (T025-T037)
- **User Story 2**: 8 tasks (T038-T045)
- **User Story 3**: 9 tasks (T046-T054)
- **Setup**: 13 tasks (T001-T013)
- **Foundational**: 11 tasks (T014-T024)
- **Cross-cutting**: 37 tasks (Sharing, UX, Performance, Polish)

**Parallel Opportunities**: ~35% of tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**Critical Path**: Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí DCA Calculator ‚Üí User Story 1 = MVP (37 tasks)

**Recommended MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only)

---

## Notes

- All file paths assume `crypto-dca-simulator/` as project root
- [P] marker indicates parallelizable tasks (different files)
- [US1/US2/US3] markers trace tasks to user stories
- DCA Calculator (T025-T026) is CRITICAL - 100% test coverage required
- Constitution gates must pass before merge to main branch
- Each user story should be independently deployable
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
