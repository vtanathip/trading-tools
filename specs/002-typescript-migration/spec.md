# TypeScript Migration - Feature Specification

**Feature ID**: 002-typescript-migration  
**Parent Feature**: 001-crypto-dca-simulator  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Priority**: HIGH (Constitution Compliance)

## Problem Statement

The crypto-dca-simulator was initially implemented in JavaScript (ES6+). Constitution v1.1.0, ratified on 2025-10-20, mandates that all JavaScript/Node.js projects MUST use TypeScript exclusively with strict mode enabled. The current JavaScript implementation violates this constitutional requirement.

## Goal

Migrate the entire crypto-dca-simulator codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript to achieve full compliance with Constitution v1.1.0, including:

- TypeScript with `strict: true` configuration
- 95% minimum type coverage
- Zero type errors (`tsc --noEmit` must pass)
- No `.js` source files (except configuration files where TS support is limited)
- Maintain 100% test coverage for dcaCalculator (critical financial logic)
- Maintain 80%+ general test coverage

## Success Criteria

### SC-001: TypeScript Infrastructure
**Given** the project has TypeScript installed and configured, **When** running `tsc --noEmit`, **Then** the command completes successfully with zero errors.

### SC-002: Strict Mode Compliance
**Given** tsconfig.json exists, **When** reviewing the configuration, **Then** `"strict": true` is enabled along with all strict-mode sub-options.

### SC-003: Type Coverage Threshold
**Given** the migration is complete, **When** running type coverage analysis, **Then** at least 95% of the codebase has explicit type annotations.

### SC-004: No JavaScript Source Files
**Given** the migration is complete, **When** listing source files in `src/` directory, **Then** only `.ts` and `.tsx` files exist (no `.js` or `.jsx` files except configuration).

### SC-005: Test Coverage Maintained
**Given** all code is migrated to TypeScript, **When** running the test suite with coverage, **Then** dcaCalculator has 100% coverage and overall coverage is >= 80%.

### SC-006: Build and Runtime Success
**Given** the TypeScript migration is complete, **When** running `npm run dev`, **Then** the application starts successfully and all features work identically to the JavaScript version.

### SC-007: CI/CD Integration
**Given** TypeScript is fully integrated, **When** running CI/CD pipeline, **Then** type checking is enforced before merge and fails on any type errors.

## Non-Goals

- **Performance Optimization**: This migration focuses solely on type safety, not performance improvements
- **Feature Changes**: No new features or functionality changes beyond TypeScript conversion
- **Refactoring**: Maintain existing architecture and patterns; don't restructure code
- **Dependency Updates**: Only TypeScript-related dependencies; don't upgrade React, Chart.js, etc.

## Constitutional Compliance

This feature directly satisfies Constitution v1.1.0:

**Principle I (Code Quality - Type Safety)**:
- ✅ TypeScript Required: Converts all .js files to .ts/.tsx
- ✅ Strict Mode: tsconfig.json with `strict: true`
- ✅ Type Coverage: 95% minimum enforced
- ✅ Zero Type Errors: `tsc --noEmit` gate enforced
- ✅ No Escape Hatches: Any `@ts-ignore` or `any` usage documented

**Principle II (Testing Standards)**:
- ✅ Maintains 100% coverage for dcaCalculator (critical financial logic)
- ✅ Maintains 80%+ general test coverage
- ✅ All tests migrated to TypeScript with proper typing

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ Type checking enforced in CI/CD
- ✅ ESLint configured for TypeScript
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks run type checking

## Technical Approach

### Migration Strategy: Bottom-Up

1. **Foundation First**: Install TypeScript tooling and configure strict mode
2. **Types Layer**: Define all interfaces matching data-model.md
3. **Utilities Layer**: Migrate pure functions with no external dependencies
4. **Services Layer**: Migrate business logic with type-safe interfaces
5. **Components Layer**: Migrate React components with typed props
6. **Application Layer**: Migrate app entry points and integration
7. **Validation**: Verify Constitution compliance and cleanup

### Rationale for Bottom-Up

- Lower layers have fewer dependencies, easier to migrate
- Type definitions available for higher layers to reference
- Continuous validation at each layer ensures correctness
- Maintains working application throughout migration
- Easier rollback if issues discovered

### Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: Breaking changes during migration → **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite runs after each phase
- **Risk**: Type errors too complex to resolve → **Mitigation**: Bottom-up approach means simpler code migrated first
- **Risk**: `any` escape hatches creeping in → **Mitigation**: Strict mode from start, type coverage tool enforces 95%
- **Risk**: Lost functionality → **Mitigation**: Integration tests verify all features work identically

## Rollout Plan

1. **Phase 1-2**: Setup and types (non-breaking, code still runs)
2. **Phase 3-4**: Migrate utils, services, components (incremental, tested)
3. **Phase 5**: Migrate app entry points (full TypeScript compilation)
4. **Phase 6**: Validation and cleanup (Constitution gates)
5. **Merge**: After all gates pass, merge to main branch

## Dependencies

- Existing JavaScript codebase (crypto-dca-simulator Phase 3 MVP complete)
- All tests passing in JavaScript version
- Constitution v1.1.0 requirements documented

## Estimated Effort

- **Total Time**: 8-12 hours
- **Tasks**: 54 tasks across 6 phases
- **Complexity**: Medium (well-defined conversion, existing tests provide safety net)
- **Team Size**: 1 developer (independent work, minimal coordination needed)
