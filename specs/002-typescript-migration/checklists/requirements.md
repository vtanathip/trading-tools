# TypeScript Migration - Requirements Checklist

**Feature**: 002-typescript-migration  
**Date**: 2025-10-20  
**Purpose**: Verify specification completeness before implementation

This checklist ensures the TypeScript migration specification meets Constitution standards and is ready for implementation.

## Content Quality

- [x] **Clear Problem Statement**: Constitutional violation (JavaScript used instead of TypeScript) clearly identified with rationale
- [x] **Measurable Success Criteria**: 7 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-007) with specific acceptance tests
- [x] **Technical Approach Documented**: Bottom-up migration strategy explained with phase breakdown
- [x] **Risk Assessment**: 5 risks identified with likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategies

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] **All Functional Requirements Listed**: Migration covers all 46 JavaScript files in crypto-dca-simulator
- [x] **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance (no regression), maintainability (95% type coverage), compatibility (all features preserved)
- [x] **Edge Cases Considered**: Type errors, `any` escape hatches, breaking changes, test failures
- [x] **Dependencies Mapped**: Blocked by 001-crypto-dca-simulator Phase 3 completion (✅ done)
- [x] **Acceptance Scenarios**: Given-When-Then format for all 7 success criteria
- [x] **Constitution Compliance**: Directly addresses Principle I (Type Safety) requirements
- [x] **Data Model Alignment**: Type definitions match data-model.md from parent feature exactly
- [x] **Test Coverage Requirements**: 100% dcaCalculator, 80%+ general, all tests migrated to TypeScript

## Feature Readiness

- [x] **Implementation Plan Available**: [plan.md](plan.md) with 6 phases, timeline, dependencies
- [x] **Task Breakdown Created**: [tasks.md](tasks.md) with 54 tasks across 6 phases
- [x] **Parallel Opportunities Identified**: 19 tasks marked with [P] for parallel execution (35%)
- [x] **Independent Testing Strategy**: Each phase has clear gate (e.g., type-check, tests pass, coverage thresholds)

## Summary

✅ **SPECIFICATION COMPLETE AND READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

- Total tasks: 54
- Estimated timeline: 8-12 hours
- Parallel opportunities: 19 tasks (35%)
- Constitution compliance: Principle I (Type Safety) fully addressed
- Risk level: Medium (well-defined conversion with test safety net)
- Blocking issues: None (all prerequisites met)

**Next Step**: Begin implementation with Phase 1 (TypeScript Foundation - 4 tasks)
